# This is not built directly. It documents the common runner contract:
# - root entrypoint that maps PUID/PGID to appuser/appgroup, then drops privileges
# - /app as working directory
#
# Each runner Dockerfile copies `runners/_common/entrypoint.sh` and ensures
# `gosu` is installed and `appuser/appgroup` exist.
